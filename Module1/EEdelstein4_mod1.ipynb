    "\n",
    "We've all seen autocomplete.\n",
    "You start to type a word, after the first 1, 2, 3 characters (normally at least 2), the program suggests completions for the word (hence the name!).\n",
    "It can be basic (just suggest some words), smart (suggest words sorted by frequency), or super smart (suggest words based on previous words).\n",
    "\n",
    "Autocomplete seems like it could require AI but it doesn't...at least not the basic or smart forms.\n",
    "You're going to implement the basic form.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Binary Search\n",
    "\n",
    "The most naive approach would be to scan a dictionary of words.\n",
    "That's going to be $O(n)$ in the dictionary.\n",
    "That's not good.\n",
    "Another way is to use a binary search.\n",
    "\n",
    "With binary search, the program sees that we have typed \"ca\" and finds the position in a sorted list of words.\n",
    "It then expands from that position to collect all the words that have that prefix (\"ca\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the pseudocode for both functions:\n",
